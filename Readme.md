# Readme
1. This is for Testing purposes only no other than that will be added here except for those..
2. Practice codes are uploaded here so that we can work on different projects.

# Test Repository
This repository contains code and scripts used solely for testing and experimentation purposes. It serves as a sandbox for evaluating various programming concepts, algorithms, and frameworks.

<h2> Purpose </h2>
The goal of this repository is to:

1. Test code snippets and small projects.
2. Explore different technologies and experiment with API integrations.
3. Debug and refine algorithms for learning and development.

<h2> Contents </h2>
Sample Programs: Code snippets that demonstrate basic functionality and concepts.
Algorithm Implementations: Test implementations of sorting algorithms, CNN models, and more.
Problem Solving: Add solving some programming tests.
Implementations of Algorithm to a real life problems.
